# Unitary Fund Research
A repository for archived research code and tutorials on open-source quantum software.

- [Noise-extended probabilistic error cancellation (NEPEC)](/nepec/). Phys. Rev. A 104, 052607 (2021), arXiv:2108.02237.

## Tutorials
This repository also holds notebooks for tutorials used in presentations and workshops.
- [Compilation with BQSKit combined with error mitigation from `mitiq`](./ieee-quantum-week/compilation-with-error-mitigation-tutorial/bqskit.ipynb)
- [Programming neutral-atom analog quantum processors with Bloqade](./ieee-quantum-week/neutral-atom-tutorial/Bloqade_tutorial_1.ipynb)
- [The Weisfeiler-Lehman Test with Pulser](./ieee-quantum-week/neutral-atom-tutorial/weisfeiler-lehman-test-tutorial/weisfeiler-lehman-test-tutorial.ipynb)

The `neutral-atom-tutorial` directory contains also tutorials from Pulser documentation:
